# SavorAI
AI-powered food waste management system
Project Overview

SavorAI is an AI-driven food waste management system designed to help individuals and organizations reduce food waste by suggesting recipes, homemade remedies, and alternative uses for ingredients. By leveraging artificial intelligence, SavorAI provides personalized recommendations based on available ingredients, estimated preparation time, and additional user preferences.

How SavorAI Addresses Sustainability Challenges

Food waste is a major global issue, contributing to environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emissions and resource wastage. SavorAI promotes sustainability by:

Encouraging efficient utilization of food items before they spoil.

Suggesting alternative non-food uses (e.g., skincare, composting, natural cleaners).

Helping users make informed decisions to minimize waste and save money.

AI Technologies Used

SavorAI employs various AI and data analysis techniques, including:

Natural Language Processing (NLP): To process user inputs and identify food items.

Machine Learning Recommendation System: To suggest the best recipes and remedies.

Time Estimation Model: Predicts preparation time based on ingredient complexity and cooking steps.

Database Integration: Uses SQLite or Firebase to store user preferences and optimize future suggestions.

Real-World Impact and Potential Applications

Households: Individuals can minimize waste by cooking with what they already have.

Restaurants and Cafeterias: Businesses can find creative ways to use excess ingredients.

Grocery Stores: Can suggest recipes for near-expiry products to customers.

Food Donation and Sustainability Initiatives: Helps organizations make better use of donated items.

Challenges Faced and Solutions

Understanding User Input: Used NLP models to accurately identify ingredients from various inputs.

Data Availability: Integrated external APIs like Spoonacular for recipe data.

Time Prediction Accuracy: Trained a model based on real cooking time datasets.

Career Influence and Next Steps

This project has reinforced the importance of AI in sustainability. Future plans include:

Expanding the recipe database with region-specific cuisine support.

Developing a mobile app version.

Collaborating with restaurants and supermarkets for real-world deployment.
